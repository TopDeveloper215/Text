I am web & mobile app developer who have rich experiences on freelancer.com.
My common monthly income was 3000~4000USD. My account level was top 3% of the platform but unfortunately, it was closed a few weeks ago. 
So I need another account to continue work.
Creating account needs verify identify and payment. So I can't use my identity again because I already used it. 
If you create your account on  freelancer.com and lend me it, I will share you of monthly income. 
You can create your account and connect your payment to the account. 
If I make money on your account, the money will go to your PayPal or card. You will get your part of money and send me the rest of money.

/////Third method////////

Hi.
Hope you're doing well.
I would like to give you a suggestion to make money together.
Do you know Freelancer.com?
Freelancer.com is a world wide online job site where anyone can earn a lot of money.
I worked for an IT company for 5 years, I created my freelancer account 7 years ago, I did not use my freelancer account while I worked for an IT company because I didn't need to do a side job because the salary was enough.
But currently my company has got trouble financially so many employees are getting fired and salary is getting reduced, so I need to get a side job on a freelancing platform, so I tried to login my account.
But it seemed to be closed already I think because it has not been active for a long time.
Due to freelancer rules, I can't create an account with my ID card again.
So, I am looking for someone to create an account on my behalf and lend to me.
If you create a freelancer account(https://freelancer.com) and lend to me, I will share my income with you.
After I earn money, you can withdraw all the money I earned from your account to your card or PayPal and just keep your share and give me the rest.
Also, if you want I will get a project that suits your skills and will give the project to you.
If you are interested in this offer, please send me a message "Hello, friend" via skype.

//////Anydesk us


If you need to use your pc for your business, it is okay for me as well 
I just asked it is very good option to use acc on your real IP address due to freelancer terms of services
When you verify your identity , then you need to fill out your ID detail which involves location where you live.
If we use IP address of other location than your KYC location, it is not good in using  your account safely
The most important things is just to use acc very safely, 
Even I use ph proxy, then we should only access to your acc with that py proxy of browser
Freelancer site is strict website for security and scam action, So If we use different IP address, account will be banned
If you need to use your laptop for your business, thaen we can use acc on ph proxy.
But at this time , you are required to only access via Ph proxy which will be provided by me 
Or If it is not convenient, you can access your acc via anydesk on my pc, 
According to freelancer's terms and conditions, one user cannot access his/her account from different IP locations.
Of course, there may be cases where you need to move to a remote area or country for work and need to access your freelancer account.
The safest way is to use your account using anydesk from your real IP, the second possible way is to use a proxy.
In this case, you must only access your account through the proxy I provide.
If I'm logged in from IP A and you try to log in from IP B, the freelancer AI bot will detect this and apply a usage ban to our account.
