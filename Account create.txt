			**************Account Create**************


**************First Method**************

Hi.
Hope you are doing well.
We are kind of a team of software engineers and we do mainly website, mobile app and game development projects work.
We have very good and high rated profiles on several freelancing platforms, so our monthly income is pretty high.
I am planning to expand our business, thatâ€™s why I am looking for a new online partner who can provide us with a Freelancer account.
If you create a Freelancer account(https://Freelancer.com) and lend to me, I will share my income with you.
After I earn money, you can withdraw all the money I earned from your account to your card or PayPal and just keep your share and give me the rest.
Simply, you would be the real person who opens the Freelancer account and act as just the face of that account, and we will be the real ones who work on the projects coming from the account.
If you interested this offer, please send me message "Hi, friend" via skype or discord.

**************Second Method**************

Hi.
Hope you're doing well.
I would like to give you a suggestion to make money together.
Do you know Freelancer.com?
Freelancer.com is a world wide online job site where anyone can earn a lot of money.
I worked for an IT company for 5 years, I created my Freelancer account 7 years ago, I did not use my Freelancer account while I worked for an IT company because I didn't need to do a side job because the salary was enough.
But currently my company has got trouble financially so many employees are getting fired and salary is getting reduced, so I need to get a side job on a freelancing platform, so I tried to login my account.
But it seemed to be closed already I think because it has not been active for a long time.
Due to Freelancer rules, I can't create an account with my ID card again.
So, I am looking for someone to create an account on my behalf and lend to me.
If you create a Freelancer account(https://Freelancer.com) and lend to me, I will share my income with you.
After I earn money, you can withdraw all the money I earned from your account to your card or PayPal and just keep your share and give me the rest.
Also, if you want I will get a project that suits your skills and will give the project to you.
If you are interested in this offer, please send me a message "Hello, friend" via skype.

**************Third Method**************

**************Fourth Method**************


I am web & mobile app developer who have rich experiences on Freelancer.com.

Creating account needs verify identify and payment. So I can't use my identity again because I already used it.

				**************Why use Anydesk**************


If you need to use your pc for your business, it is okay for me as well 
I just asked it is very good option to use acc on your real IP address due to Freelancer terms of services
When you verify your identity , then you need to fill out your ID detail which involves location where you live.
If we use IP address of other location than your KYC location, it is not good in using  your account safely
The most important things is just to use acc very safely, 
Even I use ph proxy, then we should only access to your acc with that py proxy of browser
Freelancer site is strict website for security and scam action, So If we use different IP address, account will be banned
If you need to use your laptop for your business, thaen we can use acc on ph proxy.
But at this time , you are required to only access via Ph proxy which will be provided by me 
Or If it is not convenient, you can access your acc via anydesk on my pc, 
According to Freelancer's terms and conditions, one user cannot access his/her account from different IP locations.
Of course, there may be cases where you need to move to a remote area or country for work and need to access your Freelancer account.
The safest way is to use your account using anydesk from your real IP, the second possible way is to use a proxy.
In this case, you must only access your account through the proxy I provide.
If I'm logged in from IP A and you try to log in from IP B, the Freelancer AI bot will detect this and apply a usage ban to our account.


				**************What is Freelancer.com**************



If client post project, many Freelancer users bid on that project.
So, client discuss about own project with Freelancers, and award project to selected developer.
If I selected, I can work on client's project.
After finish project, I can receive money from client.
money will be come to your Freelancer account.
So, you can withdraw money as all or needed quantity to your debit card or paypal.


				**************For Trust**************


You can check all the status of your account in real time through Gmail.
All messages coming into your freelance account are automatically sent to Gmail.
So you can see all the chat history of your account.
Also, when you withdraw money, the money will automatically go to the card or PayPal linked to this account, regardless of who withdraws it.
So, there is no risk.


**************Photo**************

I need a  photo of the person standing upright similar to an identity photo , or  of the following type:
Are there any photos of you sitting in front of a PC or with a PC in the background?

Generally, many freelancer uploads developer-like pictures to own account. They upload pictures of themselves sitting in front of a computer or standing upright, and specially, the more pictures they upload of virgins, the more chances they have to make money.


---Why need payment verify?

You need to verify payment for withdraw money on your freelancer account.
If I earn money on your freelancer account, you can withdraw that all money to your credit card.
When withdraw, money will be transfer your card automatically.
So, you need to connect your credit card to your account.

---Why can't I create account?

I'm from Philippines, so recently, Philippines freelancer account can't withdraw money from freelancer account.
So I need your help.
