generate important 3 or 4 questions to the client who posted the job posting above

How should I say it in 1 simple technical sentence to prove to the client who post this project my ability for this task?
Please start with "I can".
Only technical sentence!


Give me 1 sentence about main purpose of this project.
He's not a tech guy, I need to ask about requirements. 
Most of questions you provided should be solved by the developer
I need to ask that client can answer from their side
