I am a highly skilled and experienced Threat Intelligence professional with a proven track record of developing and implementing effective solutions to detect and mitigate cyber threats. I've successfully developed various tools and systems to enhance threat intelligence capabilities, including scalable scrapers, typosquatting and phishing detection tools, and infrastructure using Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Redis.

I am also experienced in digital footprint and dark web monitoring, and have conducted research on developing a complete Dark Web Threat Intel Solution. I have a strong background in programming, particularly in Python, and am well-versed in machine learning techniques to predict social engineering attacks. Overall, I am passionate about using my skills and knowledge to stay ahead of emerging threats and protect organizations from potential cyber attacks.

WORK EXPERIENCE:

• Writing scalable scrapers to scrape threat intelligence from different open source feeds and social media platforms
• Developing different tools to enrich information about IOCs, that provide information helpful in identifying phishing campaigns regarding top brands
• Developing a typosquatting tool to detect potential phishing websites of top vendors or customer domains
• Developing a tool that detects phishing websites based on favicon hash and image comparison of intelligence data with top vendor and customer domains
• Successfully developing a scalable architecture using Kafka, RabbitMQ and Redis that can handle large amounts of data and process them in parallel using async modules of these queues
• Developing an infrastructure using Docker Swarm to simulate URLs from feeds in parallel, capture their traffic and screenshots.
• Integrating phishing kit tool to search for potential phishing signatures in provided website
• Generating passive threat intel to detect zero-day threats by scanning malicious infrastructure
