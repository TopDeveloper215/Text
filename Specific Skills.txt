---------Machine Learning---------

Hello sir.
As a highly innovated web security and machine learning expert, I can do your project with 100% accuracy & am ready to start right now. 
One possible solution for your project is to implement a behavioral detection system that uses machine learning algorithms to detect abnormal voting behavior.
This can include detecting patterns such as rapid-fire voting, voting at unusual times of day, or voting from suspicious geographical locations.
To implement a behavioral detection system, you will need to collect data on normal voting behavior and use this to train your machine learning algorithms. 
This can be done by analyzing historical voting data and identifying patterns of behavior that are typical for your users. Once your algorithms have been trained, they can be used to detect abnormal behavior and flag potential autovotes for manual review.
Another approach is to use browser fingerprinting to identify and block automated voting scripts. Browser fingerprints are unique identifiers that are generated based on a user's browser configuration and can be used to track individual users across multiple devices and sessions. By analyzing browser fingerprints, you can identify patterns of behavior that are typical for automated scripts and block them from accessing your site.
If you are interested to message me we can discuss more. Thank you.

Regards,
