Enthusiasm, confidence and friendliness are the three words I would use to describe myself. My enthusiasm for software development allows me to stay motivated at work and find value in what I do. Self-confidence helps me realize my potential , discovering and learning new concepts. In addition, I consider myself a friendly person. This shows in my interactions with colleagues.
